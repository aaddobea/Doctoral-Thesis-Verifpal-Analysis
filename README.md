# DOCTORAL-THESIS TITLED  **"Exploring and Addressing the Vulnerabilities in Personalized IoT Health Computing Using Certificateless Cryptography".**
This  Verifipal analysis represents chapter 5 of the doctoral thesis  on  **"Lightweight Certificateless Hybrid Encryption Scheme for Blockchain Medical Transactions".** 
> With the following abstract: Blockchain as a decentralized technology has received significant attention from the scientific and scholarly communities due to its promising benefits. Since its inception, numerous encryption schemes have leveraged its autonomous feature to develop medically applicable schemes. However, most proposed schemes involve time-consuming operations, causing complexity issues and transaction delays, negatively impacting the blockchainâ€™s execution speed. Additionally, the expansion of on-chain data presents scalability challenges to the blockchain. In this regard, the current chapter puts forward a certificateless hybrid encryption scheme with a key encapsulation mechanism to develop a lightweight encryption model for system participants to undertake medical transactions on the blockchain. To enhance the execution speed of cryptographic operations on the blockchain, a test analysis is conducted to examine the computational and communication costs using a pairing Ethereum (Py-eth) library. Furthermore, we adopt the optimized gas values of the precompiled contracts from the Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to assess the gas cost and determine the scalability of the proposed model. Performance analysis results demonstrate that the proposed protocol achieves reduced computational overhead and gas consumption, leading to improved scalability for blockchain transaction executions.
